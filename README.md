# Obsidian Gardener Plugin

This is a Gardener plugin for Krish's Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It has one command as of now: to copy a note to a new location. I will use this as I have a separate directory for my personal website, and I want to be able to copy notes from my Obsidian vault to that directory.

TODO: add automatic github deployment
